# Warehouse

### System Execution Workflow

The system follows a continuous operational loop consisting of the following stages:

1. **Startup Phase**: All components—such as the robotic arm and conveyor belt—are powered on and initialized.
2. **Object Detection**: The system scans the shelf to locate boxes ready for pickup.
3. **Targeting & Movement**: Using 3D coordinates, the arm calculates and navigates to the precise location of the box.
4. **Grasping**: The gripper engages and securely lifts the box from its position on the shelf.
5. **Box Transfer**: The arm rotates and extends to align with the conveyor.
6. **Placement on Conveyor**: The box is carefully released onto the moving belt.
7. **Conveyance**: The conveyor system transports the item to the designated processing area.
8. **Loop Continuation**: This sequence repeats until all available boxes are processed.
9. **Standby/Shutdown**: Once tasks are complete, the system either halts or waits for the next batch.
